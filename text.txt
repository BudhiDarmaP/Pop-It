What is pop it?
Pop it literally translates as "pop it". This is a children's game, the process in which can be compared
with the ingress of air-bubble packaging film. But unlike the film, you can pop
press with the characteristic sensations and sounds "infinitely": dozens of silicone bubbles
they just push out the other way.
